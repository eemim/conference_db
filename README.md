# Conference Database Design
This project is part of the Database Design and Implementation course. The goal was to design and implement a conference database for Kokouskettu Oy, an organizer of international scientific and professional conferences. The database manages key aspects of conference planning, including:

- Assignment of organizing committee roles (chair, secretary, treasurer, etc.)
- Management of deadlines, venues, presentations, and participants
- Registration, accommodation, and social event bookings
- Generation of reports like evaluation forms and attendee lists
  
Some aspects like financial planning and exhibition arrangements are handled by separate systems.
